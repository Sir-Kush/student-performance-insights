# Student Performance Insights
*Student Performance Data Analysis and Insights*

**Project Overview**
This project aims to analyze student performance data to uncover trends, identify at-risk students, and explore factors that influence academic success. By leveraging descriptive analytics, this project provides insights into how student performance varies across subjects, attendance, and other potential variables. The project also explores predictive analytics techniques to forecast student outcomes and recommend strategies for improving academic support.

**Project Objective:**
- To analyze historical student performance data and identify trends.
- To explore the relationship between performance, attendance, and other factors.
- To predict which students are at risk of underperforming using machine learning techniques.
- To create actionable insights that can be applied to improve student outcomes in educational settings.

**Project Structure**
- data/: Contains datasets used for analysis.
  + Sample dataset: student_performance.csv
- notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts for cleaning data, performing analyses, and building predictive models.
  + Notebook 1: Descriptive Analysis of Student Performance
  + Notebook 2: Predictive Modeling for At-Risk Students
- reports/: Contains visualizations and findings based on the analyses.
  + Report 1: Performance Trends and Key Insights
- src/: Contains source code for reusable data cleaning and analysis functions.
 
**Tools and Libraries**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation and cleaning
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for predictive modeling
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive analysis
  
**Data Sources**
The data used in this project focuses on student academic performance and related factors. The following datasets are being explored:

- [Kaggle - Student Performance Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams): Contains exam scores and demographic data for students.
- [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Student Performance](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance): Provides data on student grades, demographic information, and attendance records.
You can download the datasets and place them in the data/ folder for analysis.
